The Garbage Collector

Code Location: WEB_TREE/admin/scripts/garbage_collector.php3
-- Notice this code is in the web admin directory.  It is NOT in global_stock.

Garbage in Reason is one of two things: deleted entities that haven't been
touched in over a week and empty pending items that haven't been touched in
the same time or longer.  Currently, pending items aren't touched.  The code
could easily be changed to garbage collect pending items.  The Garbage
Collector runs once a day through a cron job and finds all old entities and
deletes them.  Update: Pending items are now being deleted if they haven't
been modified in 28 days.

The GC code:
Since this is being run from the command line instead of from Apache, we have
to include a few things that are usually included by an auto-prepended file or
through some header file.  

The current query being used to find items to delete is this:
SELECT
	id,
	name,
	DATE_FORMAT(last_modified,'%M %e, %Y %r') AS last_modified
FROM
	entity
WHERE
	( state = 'Deleted' AND 
	  last_modified < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY) ) OR
	( state = 'Pending' AND 
	  last_modified < DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 28 DAY ) )";
	
Really, all it does is grab the ids of entities that are deleted and have not
been modified in 7 days and the pending items that haven't been modified in
28 days. I then loop through the ids to delete and delete all
of them, saving the output to an array to dump out at the end.


The crontab entry:

4 4 * * * ~/bin/php -d include_path=/usr/local/webapps/www/global_stock/php:.
/usr/local/webapps/www/admin/scripts/garbage_collector.php3 > 
~/garbage/webapps_garbage_dump.txt

It's pretty long.  Here's the breakdown.  The first line has two things: When
to run the GC and the program that runs it.  For more information about how
crontab determines the time to run things, look at the man pages. 4 4 * * *
means run every day at 4:04 AM.   Notice that here I am using the
compiled version of PHP - this avoids all the problems of authenticating
through the web server.  Currently, the compiled PHP executable is in my
(Dave's) directory in the bin directory.  A few options need to be passed to
this: the include_path and the script to run.  The include_path is usually set
up in an .htaccess file, but since this is being run from the command line, no
htaccess is hit.  So it runs the file and dumps the output to some file,
currently set to a file in my home directory.  This is to have some record
of what was deleted the last time the GC was run.

In my crontab entry, there are two of these crontabs: one for webapps and one
for webdev.  The differences between the files are pretty simple - they just
connect to different databases and do their work on those databases.
