This document is intended to give an overview of the Loki codebase so that developers
other than me don't get lost. Please excuse my writing's stylistic faults: I'm writing
quickly. For more information, of course, consult the comments on each file. Most of the
classes and functions are documented using JSDoc.

Loki 2.0 has a small amount of php code and a much larger amount of js code. The php code
basically just loads the js code, inits the js Loki object, and passes various parameters
to it.

The js code is organized into two groups, Util and UI. The code in Util is independent of Loki,
and mostly consists of classes intended to abstract away browser differences. The classes in
Util are mostly grouped around existing js or dom objects, e.g. Util.Node, Util.Object, 
Util.Selection.  

The code in UI is what actually implements Loki. The primary class, by which all others are 
ultimately driven, is UI.Loki. UI.Loki
