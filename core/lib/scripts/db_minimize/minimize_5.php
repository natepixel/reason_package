<h1>Minimize this Reason Instance: Done</h1>
<p>You are now done minimizing this Reason instance.  It is now ready to be used as a base for a local copy.</p>
<p>It's probably a good idea to do a dump of this DB now so you have a record of this state</p>
<h3>Creating a core instance</h3>
<p>If you wish to create a core instance of Reason, there is <a href="minimize_to_core.php">one final step</a>.</p>
