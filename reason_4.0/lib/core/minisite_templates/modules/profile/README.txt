Profiles should be deployed on a site that runs the 3 modules in this directory on separate page types.

- profile
- profile_list
- profile_explore

You'll likely want to review and configure reason_package/reason_4.0/lib/core/config/modules/profile/config.php

@todo modify profile_list and profile_explore to share navigation with profile ... 
@todo ... maybe make profile navigation a separate part of the function library so it is easily shared.
