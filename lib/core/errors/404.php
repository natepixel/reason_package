<h3>Oops.</h3>
  <p>We're sorry. The link you clicked or the URL you typed in didn't work for 
    some reason. Techies call this a 404 error. Here are some of the reasons why 
    that might have happened:</p>
	<ul>
    <li>We might have a bad link on one of our pages, which sent you to the wrong 
      place when you clicked it.</li>
	<li>You might have typed in the web address incorrectly.</li>
	<li>Someone might have sent you an email that had an incorrect web address.</li>
	<li>Our server could be having problems.</li>
	</ul>
<p>If you think that there's a bad link on a page, <?php if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])) echo "<a href='" . $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] . "'>"; ?> go back to the page that 
    had the link<?php if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])) echo "</a>"; ?>, and there should be contact information for the person who maintains 
    it on the page. Please contact them (email is always good) and let them know about the problem!</p>
<p>If you can't figure out who to contact, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:<?php
	echo WEBMASTER_EMAIL_ADDRESS;
  	if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']))
	{ ?>?subject=Bad Link&body=Hello.%0D%0DI've%20found%20a%20bad%20link%20at%20<?php echo (urlencode($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'])); ?>%20%0D%20%0DThe link tried to take me to <?php echo (urlencode($_SERVER['SCRIPT_URI'])); ?>, which does not exist!%0D%20%0DCould%20you%20fix%20it,%20please?%0D%0DThank%20You!<?php 
	} ?>"><?php echo WEBMASTER_EMAIL_ADDRESS; ?></a>. 
    Make sure to let us know where the bad link was located. Thanks!</p>
